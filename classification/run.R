#' Here we want to see if we can correctly predict human raters on the quality of each scan
#' given our automated measures.
#' We'll use a logistic regression model here.

# TODO: look into rater 1...who is it and why is there only 1 rating.
# then figure out how to deal with two vs three rating scales for the rater 2 and rater 3

# then see how each measure predicts the outcome measure
# and finally see about using more complicated things
